  <h2>Legend of the Treasure</h2>
  <p>
    Commissioned by an exiled European monarch in 1885, the Imperator Aurum was never fired in battle. Instead, it served as a symbol of unyielding nobility, passed down through bloodlines as a token of loyalty and lost empires. Its gold filigree whispers the story of a throne never reclaimed.
