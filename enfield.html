  <h2>Legend of the Royal Enfield</h2>
  <p>
    At the heart of the Model KX was its 1,140cc side-valve V-twin engine â€” a true powerhouse for its time. Built primarily for smooth, effortless long-distance cruising, the engine was paired with a four-speed, hand-change gearbox and a chain final drive. The KX was designed for riders who demanded both performance and luxury, offering a refined yet robust ride.
